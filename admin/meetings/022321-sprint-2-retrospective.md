# What Did Work

- Splitting up tasks, stopped us from mob-coding
- Smaller groups helped making coding more effective
- Self assignment worked, as we were able to choose tasks that we were interested in - made us morem otivated

# What Did Not Work

- Integration became hard with splitting up tasks, individual files had different structuring and CSS layouts that were hard to integrate
- Our integration pipeline is complicated, and mulitple members of the team don't know how to operate it
- Some people aren't able to show up to meetings, so meeting availability is tricky

# How Can We Improve

- We could possibly have made a structure / template for individual split tasks but this may have consumed more time in the planning stages of the project
- Improve coordination between pipeline and the rest of the project. Set dedicated times in meetings to cover how the pipeline works in our project
- Emphasizing more communication on slack could make coding in smaller groups easier - just keeping a higher level of communication could be better
