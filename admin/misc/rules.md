# Group 24 Team Contract

### These are the rules that are expected to be followed at all time by members of Group 24:

1. Slack will be our primary means of communication.
2. This repo will be our source of truth.
3. Be respectful of your teammates and yourself at all times.
4. Clearly and promptly communicate when you can or cannot make a commitment.
5. With exception only for extenuating circumstances, always follow through on your commitments.

### How to address rule breaches

1. If you have an issue with another team member, take it to them first.
2. If this does not work, set up a meeting to address this issue with the conflicting parties and at least one neutral party to moderate and arbitrate.
3. The Karen Clause - if neither of these methods work, take it to the manager (Sim).
