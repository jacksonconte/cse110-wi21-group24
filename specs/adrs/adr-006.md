# Switching test frameworks to Cypress

- Status: accepted, overriding [ADR-004](adr-004.md)
- Date: 2021-03-09


## Context and Problem Statement

How do we effectively test DOM using JEST, without manually pasting in HTML for each test?

## Considered Options

- Manual pasting with Jest
- Switching to Cypress
- Using Fetch with local files

## Decision Outcome

We chose Cypress because manual pasting is tedious and if we're going to import a new framework, we might as well do Cypress.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Cleaner test interface
- Easier DOM tests

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Time lost switching frameworks
