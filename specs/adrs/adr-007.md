# Having separate JS files instead of one consolidated file

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2021-03-13


## Context and Problem Statement

How do we work around JEST's problem with multiple interdependent JS files?

## Considered Options

- Consolidate into one file
- Use Cypress instead

## Decision Outcome

We switched to Cypress for different reasons, and thus have no reason to keep everything in one file (which is bad practice).
