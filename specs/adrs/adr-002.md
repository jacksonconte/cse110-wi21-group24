# Merging html pages into one page

- Status: accepted
- Deciders: everyone
- Date: 2021-02-16

## Context and Problem Statement

Local storage from one page cannot be accessed from a different page, so how should we fix that? Additionally, navigation on the sidebar menu was clunky when going between pages because there was no transition animation.

## Considered Options

- merging pages
- cloud storage

## Decision Outcome

Chose option "merging pages" because it was simple enough and allowed for smooth transitions.
