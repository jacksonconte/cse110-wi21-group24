# Start tasks off the task list by selecting them manually
- Status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

How do we take tasks off the task list?

## Considered Options

- auto-queueing tasks in order of addition to list
- having "start task" buttons on each task

## Decision Outcome

Chose second option because it offers more user flexibility (no good way to change order of tasks in task list, sadly)

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- allows tasks to be completed in any order

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- requires more user input
