# Getting rid of `prefer-const` in ESLint

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2021-03-13

## Context and Problem Statement

By default, ESLint demands that variables that are never changed be reassigned as constants. However, not everyone follows this practice, and our code currently does not.

## Considered Options

- Keeping it and changing all the appropriate `let` variables to `const`
- Removing the rule and leaving our code as is

## Decision Outcome

Chose to remove the rule because there is not much benefit to adding the `const` restriction at this stage in development.
